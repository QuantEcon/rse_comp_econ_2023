## Content

Computational methods and scientific computing are becoming increasingly
central to research, analysis and policy work in economics and finance.

This is an introductory workshop for students and policy makers who are
interested in learning about the evolution of modern scientific computing
tools and how they can be applied to economic problems. The main language used
in the workshop will be Python, although other languages will also be
discussed. The target audience is graduate students at the start of masters or
PhD programs, advanced undergraduates who want to boost their computing
skills, and policy makers at Australian policy institutions.

Topics will include simulation, vectorization, JIT compilers, and parallelization.
